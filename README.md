I aint paying code crafters

So I run it locally

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "pass 1st stage" # any msg
git push origin master
```

That's all!

# Stage 2 & beyond

Note: This section is for stages 2 and beyond.

1. Ensure you have `go (1.19)` installed locally
1. Run `./your_program.sh` to run your Redis server, which is implemented in
   `app/server.go`.
1. Commit your changes and run `git push origin master` to submit your solution
   to CodeCrafters. Test output will be streamed to your terminal.
